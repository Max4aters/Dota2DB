# Dota2DB
Website for searching items in Dota 2 more effectively than in game allows (2013)

Include mostly custom code to create a site to view, browse and search for specific items and heroes within Dota 2 based on any category, function or abilities thinkable.
(Freely sourced code used as the base for the graphical hover functionality)

The idea was to create a better item search/filtering than in game allowed to speed up learning and discovery as well as on the fly off build item selection during games.
