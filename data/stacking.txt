NO STACKING:
- damage blocking does NOT stack (each item gets a chance to fire, highest % first - Stout Shield, Poor Man's Shield, Vanguard) - 'block_chance'
- Critical Strike does NOT stack (each item gets a chance to fire, highest % first - Crystalys, Daedalus) - 'passive_crit_chance'
- Evasion stacks diminishingly (multiplicitively)
- yasha stack = movement speed % bonus
- eul's = no self movement speed (flat) stacking
- bloodstone does NOT self stack, highest priorty slot is active
- manabreak type abilities

NOW STACKS:
- magic resistance (Cloak, Hood of Defiance, Pipe of Insight) - same as usual magic resistance (multiplicatively?)
